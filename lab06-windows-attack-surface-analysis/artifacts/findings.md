# 🧾 Security Assessment Findings
## 📅 Date: 2026-02-21

This document captures manual verification notes to validate the automated results produced by the enumeration scripts, attack surface analyzer, and vulnerability scanner.

## 🌐 Network Exposure

### ✅ Open Ports Discovered
From `ss/netstat` checks and automated enumeration:

- **22/tcp (sshd)** exposed on:
  - `0.0.0.0:22` (IPv4 all interfaces)
  - `:::22` (IPv6 all interfaces)
- **53/tcp (systemd-resolved)** listening on:
  - `127.0.0.53:53` (loopback only)
- **323/tcp (chronyd)** listening on:
  - `127.0.0.1:323` (loopback only)

### 🧩 Unnecessary Services
- No legacy insecure services like **FTP (21)** or **Telnet (23)** were detected (good baseline state).
- Only **SSH** is externally reachable in this VM image.

### ⚠️ High-Risk Exposure Notes
- SSH exposed on `0.0.0.0` means the VM is reachable from any network route allowed by upstream rules.
- In production, SSH should be:
  - **restricted to a management subnet / allowlisted IPs**
  - protected by **MFA, key-only auth, fail2ban, and firewall rules**

## 🧠 Process Analysis

### 🔐 Privileged Processes With Network Access
Automated analyzer flagged these due to **root + network activity**:

- `sshd` (root) — PID `998`
- `systemd-resolved` (root) — PID `832`
- `chronyd` (root) — PID `735`

### 🧪 Suspicious Process Behaviors
- No reverse-shell patterns or suspicious command-line indicators were detected during this run.
- Enumeration checks (indicators like `nc`, `python -c`, `bash -i`) returned **clean results**.

### 📈 Resource-Intensive Processes
- `process_enum.py` caused a short CPU usage spike, which is expected during scanning.
- No abnormal long-running CPU hogs were observed.

## 🛡️ Vulnerabilities Identified

### 1) SSH config directives not explicitly set (defaults in effect)
- **Severity:** Low  
- **Evidence:** `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` shows these options commented out:
  - `#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password`
  - `#PasswordAuthentication yes`

- **Why this matters:**
  - Relying on defaults makes hardening inconsistent across environments.
  - Explicit security baselines improve auditability and compliance.

- **Recommendation:**
  - Set explicit values in sshd_config and validate the effective config using:
    - `sshd -T`

---

### 2) SUID binaries present
- **Severity:** Medium  
- **Evidence (common SUID tools):**
  - `sudo`, `su`, `pkexec`, `passwd`, `mount`, `umount`, etc.

- **Why this matters:**
  - SUID increases privilege escalation risk if binaries are outdated/misconfigured.
  - Standard in Linux but should be reviewed regularly.

- **Recommendation:**
  - Remove unnecessary SUID binaries where possible.
  - Ensure patch levels are current.
  - Monitor changes using integrity checks (AIDE, auditd, osquery, etc.).

## 📊 Risk Score: 82/100

- This score is generated by a heuristic formula:
  - Open ports score
  - Privileged process count score
  - Vulnerability scoring weight
- In a real enterprise environment, risk scoring would also include:
  - exposure context (internet-facing vs internal)
  - service criticality
  - CVE mapping
  - exploitability and controls in place

---

## ✅ Recommendations (Priority Order)

1. **Restrict SSH exposure**
   - firewall / security groups allowlist
   - disable password auth
   - apply fail2ban / rate limits

2. **Review and monitor SUID/SGID binaries**
   - keep packages patched
   - remove unused tools
   - integrity monitoring

3. **Perform periodic attack surface snapshots**
   - repeat this assessment weekly/monthly
   - compare changes over time
   - alert on new services/ports

## 📌 Notes
This cloud lab image is a realistic baseline: it has **SSH exposed**, internal-only listeners, and standard system SUID tools. The result matches typical minimal VM configurations and provides a strong practice scenario for documenting attack surface posture.
